In this project, we perform sentiment analysis over IMDB movie reviews and Twitter data.
Our goal will be to classify tweets or movie reviews as either positive or negative.
For classification, wel experiment with logistic regression as well as a Naive Bayes
classifier from python’s well­regarded machine learning package scikit­learn.
A major part of this project is the task of generating feature vectors for use in these classifiers.
We explore two methods: (1) A more traditional NLP technique where the features are
simply “important” words and the feature vectors are simple binary vectors and (2) the Doc2Vec
technique where document vectors are learned via artificial neural networks
